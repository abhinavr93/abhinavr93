- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @abhinavr93
- ðŸŽ“ I graduated with a major in  Aerospace Engineering. 
- I have some experience in development of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) Software using 
C++ and CMake. 
- Here you'll find repositories containing some of my tinkering with Rust (a language I'm increasingly starting to like).
